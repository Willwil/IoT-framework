## IoT Framework for debian like operating systems
Run
```bash
devicehive-cloud.create
```
to create binaries. Currently, all binaries will not be build, so if you need binaries you can make build for snappy and then extract binaries from snap files(it's archives, just open it with any archinve manager)
